# Leveraging-Machine-Learning-in-Distributed-Systems
Built a distributed kNN system using Python and the Ray framework to scale machine learning workloads. Parallelized computation across 10+ workers, reducing execution time by ~40% and improving throughput through optimized task scheduling and efficient resource utilization.
